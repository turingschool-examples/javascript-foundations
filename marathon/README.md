This test suite is for practice. Do not worry about time.

## Installation Steps

In order to be able to run these tests you need to install the dependencies at the root level of this repository. Find the directions at the [root-level of this repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript-foundations).

### Running the Tests

You can run the tests from the root of this repository. When you type `pwd` in the console, the last path location should be `javascript-foundations`.

Run the command `npm test marathon/test/runner-test.js`. To run other tests, just replace the test file name.
