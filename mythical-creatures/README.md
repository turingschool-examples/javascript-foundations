# Mythical Creatures

### Installation Steps

1. run `npm install`
2. Run your first test suite `npm test test/unicorn-test.js`
3. Make the tests pass
4. Lather, rinse, repeat through the creatures (in order), running tests and making things pass

### Video Tutorial!

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SDCWo2Yi2M) that walks through the setup and first mythical creature.

### Creature Order

* `unicorn`
* `vampire`
* `dragon`
* `hobbit`
* `pirate`
* `wizard`
* `medusa`
* `werewolf`
* `centaur`

### Extra Challenges

### The Dreaded `if` Statement

Can you complete implementations of each of the creatures without using `if`
statements? Think about how removing them affects your code.

### Imagine Two Creatures

Can you add two new creatures to the repository? How about a Hydra? Add unit
tests exercising some of the following concepts:

* Initializing constructor with data
* Using methods to change the internal state of an instance
* Using methods to query the internal state of an instance
