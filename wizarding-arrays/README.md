# Wizarding Arrays

## Installation Steps

In order to be able to run these tests you need to install the dependencies at the root level of this repository. Find the directions at the [root-level of this repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript-foundations).

### Running the Tests

You can run the tests from the root of this repository. When you type `pwd` in the console, the last path location should be `javascript-foundations`.

To run a single test file, enter `npm test wizarding-arrays/test/spell-test.js` in your terminal. To run other test files, simply update the command with the name of the test you would like to run.

#### Practicing new javascript features

Notice, some of the syntax with the tests and files are using newer javascript features introduced in es6, like arrow functions, block-scoped variables, and classes.  See if you can start flexing your es6 muscles and write your solutions and tests using the new syntax!  

### Make the tests pass in the following sequence:

* `test/spell-test.js`
* `test/robe-test.js`
* `test/potion-test.js`
